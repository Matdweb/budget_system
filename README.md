# 🌍 Tour Budget System

Welcome to Tour Budget System, a Next.js and TypeScript project designed specifically for tour guides to help them manage budgets for their tours effortlessly. This application offers an intuitive interface, making it accessible for non-technical users, and connects seamlessly to a MongoDB database to store all information securely and efficiently.

Tour Budget System is tailored for tour guides who need to keep track of their budgets on a day-by-day basis. This application allows tour guides to:
- **Create a new tour** and fill in the budget for each day.
- **Delete tour budgets** that are no longer required.
- **Register expenses** for each day of a tour.
- **Show a complete analysis** of budgets and expenses.
